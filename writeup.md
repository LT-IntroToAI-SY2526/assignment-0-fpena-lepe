## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

Git is a tool for tracking your code and seeing what changes have been made to it. It makes collaborating with other people easier. GitHub is just a way to use Git online, and it hosts Git repositories online.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Commiting is a change that you have made to your repository, but locally so only on your computer. Pushing is sending those commits online to github so other people can see it.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is like a project, and it is where you store your project files and code in github. They contain READMEs, which is just a file telling people about your project and important info about it.

## Looking Ahead

**What aspect of AI are you most excited to learn about this year? Explain why.**

I honestly don't think I joined this class for one specific topic. I think AI is really cool, and how it is advancing a lot currently and I think I want to learn about neural networks because I heard we dont even fully understand how they work yet. I want to learn about what AI even is.
